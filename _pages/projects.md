Here are some projects I'm proud of working on.

### [MOSES](https://github.com/ganglab-bnl/MOSES)

A foundational algorithm applying the group theoretic concept of 'symmetry' to chemical engineering. An information-minimizing method for to designing self-assembling DNA origami nanoparticle lattices. Under supervision of Dr. Jason Kahn at Brookhaven and Dr. Oleg Gang at Columbia University. Our paper was accepted to ACS Nano!

### [Synchrony](https://github.com/hyuncat/Synchrony)

An opinionated practice tool for musicians, which compares a user's recording to a MIDI score and computes the user's mistakes in real-time. Uses a probabilistic pitch detection method that utilizes the MIDI to detect note events. Under supervision of the kind NYU professor Dennis Shasha.

### [RichCluster](https://github.com/hyuncat/RichCluster)

An Rcpp library for performing hierarchical clustering on multiple enriched genomics datasets. Clusters different biological 'terms' based on overlapping gene content. Coded in C++ for fast clustering, with customizable linkage / distance metrics and supporting visualizations. (Paper-in-progress)

### [Pre-Walkwise](https://github.com/hyuncat/pre-walkwise)

Scripts and web app to implement and visualize Kalman filtering and Map-Matching algorithms for GPS time-series data. For use in preprocessing the training data for Caspar Lant's (Columbia CS PhD.) Walkwise model, which predicts pedestrian intent at intersections.

### [daily-integral](https://github.com/hyuncat/daily-integral)

<img src="/assets/images/projects/daily-integral-logo.png" alt="" width="300"/>

Solve a new integral every day, and compete against friends on a daily leaderboard. Created with React and MongoDB backend with secure user authentication. 

I hosted the site using Vercel [daily-integral.vercel.app](here) and created a video demo of it for my web development class at Columbia.

### [playlistify](https://github.com/hyuncat/playlistify)

A Spotify playlist sharing (and analyzing) social app!

### [congress-cut](https://github.com/hyuncat/congressLLM)

For Columbia's 2024 DevFest, I worked with my friends Moises and Andromeda to build a web app that uses content classification AI to parse Congress documents for searchable topics. Our project was awarded "Best Use of Google Cloud".
