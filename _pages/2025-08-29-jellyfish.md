## Jellyfish

Crystal blue, beautiful entrails\
tangling themselves into the\
fibers of my muscles\
a bloom of jellyfish swimming through my over-trodden veins.\
It's a cool sensationâ€”their syrupy liqueur\
shooting through the toothpicks in my spine.

I don't get it.

I've been skewered,\
and sprawled out like a taxidermied pig,\
pins stuck through every\
centimeter of jelly. Dissection?\
Or a minstrel show?

Wandering eyes come and go\
gawking at me. Pity, disgust,\
heat-seeking needles prodding at my insides\
trying to straighten out something\
that I didn't want straightening in the first place.
