## About me
I'm a senior at Columbia University, studying CS and math. I'm interested in IoT and robotics, as the application of my CS education to real-world impact.

### New to my blog? Start here
I've written three series of blog posts which span the essential bits of who I am and what I've been thinking about over the past year.

- [Spring 2025](/_posts/2025-02-18-ganglab-daily.md)
- [Summer 2025](/_posts/2025-08-27-summer-2025.md)
- [Fall 2025](/_posts/2025-12-01-fall-2025.md)

I also write enjoy writing poetry! A friend told me he thinks writing poetry helps him learn more about himself. You can see my attempts at that [here](/tags/#poem).

## Projects
I'm currently involved in two research projects.

1. [**MOSES**](https://github.com/ganglab-bnl/MOSES) (Columbia Gang Lab) - An information-minimizing algorithm applying the group theoretic concept of 'symmetry' to enable DNA origami self-assembly. Published in [ACS Nano](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.4c17408) and featured on the [front cover](https://pubs.acs.org/toc/ancac3/19/15)!

2. [**TuneBuddy**](https://github.com/hyuncat/Synchrony) (NYU Dennis Shasha Group) - An opinionated practice tool for musicians, which compares a user's recording to a MIDI score and computes the user's mistakes in real-time. Under supervision of the kind NYU professor Dennis Shasha.

I also help lead the Columbia Robotics Club—encompassed in which lie two more projects.

1. [**MakeCU**](https://www.makecu.dev/) - Columbia's flagship hardware hackathon. I was the co-director in planning this event, alongside [Joseph](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jleetj/) (the goat). I wroteup a retrospective of the event [here](/_posts/2025-11-12-makecu.md).

2. [**CCBR**](https://www.ccbr.dev/) - An open-source modular humanoid project, in collaboration with some friends I met at [ICRA](/_posts/2025-05-27-icra.md). I'm the Columbia liason and a founding software member of the team.

For fun, I also play violin in the Barrio Tango Orchestra with some amazing friends.
