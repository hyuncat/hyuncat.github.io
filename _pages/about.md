## About me
Thanks for visiting my blog! I am in my third year at Columbia University, studying CS and math. Hence, most of my posts are related to the math and CS topics I've been learning through my studies and research.

I'm currently involved in two research projects.
1. **MOSES** (Columbia Gang Lab) - A DNA origami bond coloring algorithm which uses group theory and symmetry mapping to reduce the number of unique DNA sequences to enable the self-assembly of a nanoparticle superlattice. This [blog post](/_posts/2024-10-06-ganglab.md) talks about it more in depth.
2. **???** (NYU Dennis Shasha Group) - A practice tool for musicians which compares a users' music performances to a MIDI score, plotting their pitch, volume, rhythm over time, and giving feedback. (Name TBD)

For fun, I also play violin in the Barrio Tango Orchestra with some really amazing people. My friend and I have both started learning tango as well. üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
