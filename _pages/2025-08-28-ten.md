I ended the summer at the same time I ended a situationship with a guy 10 years older than me.

## An unexpected brush with a kindred soul

### A chance post-concert dinner

We knew each other from both playing in Barrio Tango Orchestra, but we got to know each other better after our Philadelphia concert. Everyone else had boarded their trains back to NYC already, so it was just us two left with 3 hours to spare before our respective trainsâ€”so we got dinner together at Suraya (it was bomb). 

Through our conversation, we realized we get along pretty well.
His name was Michaelâ€”he was in a frat in college, then spent some time working at startups and big tech, before quitting to write his isekai-deconstruction light novel full time. We bonded over both having bitchless Instagram explore pages, having anime phases, and being into daily puzzle games.

And he was 31.

### The Jacob Collier concert

We texted on-and-off for the next couple weeksâ€”sharing poetry, music, and brainrotted Instagram reels, before I impulsively asked him if he'd be interested to go see Jacob Collier perform in Central Park together. Surprisingly, he said yes.

#### Bonding over Fish Cheeks

The day of the concert, we got dinner beforehand at [Fish Cheeks](https://www.fishcheeksnyc.com/) (which was really good!) where we bonded over both growing up online in the world of MMORPGs. We then stopped by Scent Lab to try out some perfumes before sharing earbuds while riding over to Central Park to see Jacob.

#### Escalating concert-going tensions

The park is super crowded, so I reach for his arm as we make our way through the crowd. He's taken aback, but we soon start interlocking hands and snaking our way towards a better view of the stage.

We're shoulder-to-shoulder all throughout the concert, interluded with moments of physicality to gush over Jacob's brilliant musicality and technique. 

Mid-concert, Jacob stops to talk about how he loves music for how it cuts through all languages, and can be universally understood. That it can help us come together and be kinder to one another, especially given the current instability of the world. 

- Jacob goes, "We need more soft people," 
- to which Michael jokes "he's advocating for more soft bois in the world ðŸ¥º". 

I elbowed him for ruining the moment.

#### A different light

From then on, we start texting more frequently. Our next tango concert is around the corner, and I notice that Juyoun has seated us right next to each otherâ€”in an almost knowing way.\
We're performing at *La Nacional*, "the Carnegie Hall of tango." 

### The La Nacional concert

It's concert day, and we spend the evening together, Juyoun and Liyu snapping mischievous pictures of us together whenever they get the chance. 

#### A deep conversation

After performing, we go to [Bar Bonobo](https://barbonobo.com/) for post-concert drinks. We try gathering a crew of people to go, but it ends up being me, Liyu, and Michael. All three of us are pretty nerdy people, and the topics of systems of power and cynicism are on my mindâ€”so I end up asking a bunch of pointed questions.
- "How does tango fit into your relationship with music?"
- "What does art mean to you? Why do you create it?"
- "How do you cope with living in a capitalist system built upon exploitation?"
- "What motivates you to study for the LSAT?"

#### Juyoun's pointed comments

After 2.5 hours of yapping about music, art, and universal healthcare, Juyoun joins us. I tell her "we're talking about our relationships with music." And she mishears and exclaims, "You're talking about relationships with age gaps? 10 years?"\
"Age is just a number!"

Which made me wince. When did Juyoun catch on?

## Nice getting-to-know you!

Over the next two weeks, we start hanging out. We hung out a total of five times after the concert.

1. Dizzy's Club + Brandy Library
2. Piano Lesson #1 + Lunatico
3. Surprise: Birdland Jazz
4. Piano Lesson #2 + Barcade
5. Surprise: Planning Long Island

### 1. Dizzy's Club + Brandy Library

We plan a visit to a jazz club called Dizzy's Club, getting drinks and analyzing the ways the performers are subverting the expectations of the prototypical 12-bar blues.

Afterwards, we went to the Brandy Library (which purpottedly had his favorite cocktail in NYC) and chatted for a while catching each other up on our backgrounds. We talk about our relationship types:

- He explained how he's into nerds, typically East Asian.
- I thread the common denominator of eccentricity across all my crushes.

But at some point, he brings up how his younger brother (who's 29) got married this past year. And I paused.

I was having fun just talking with him, because I felt like he understood me. But hearing this shook the 10 year age gap deep into my bones. That he's dating to marry.

I left feeling uneasy, fearing if we could even work out. Still, he texted making sure I got back home safe. Swallowing my concerns, we planned concretely for our first piano lesson.

### 2. Piano lesson #1 + Lunatico

A couple days before our lesson, he texts me saying he had transcribed all of this [For Lovers](https://open.spotify.com/track/6BGNjTZ8zp9MlsIydBa7A9?si=f0b6c5945e174e07) song for me to learn. It was a song from one of my favorite albumsâ€”one I had shared with him before.

#### A nice lesson
I ride the C train to his apartment in Brooklyn for our first piano lesson. I walk in and see a video analyzing the music theory behind some viral clip on his monitor, and he offers me drinks + Asian snacks. 

We start diving into his For Lovers arrangement, and I end up learning a lot on the different chords within a key, and how they behave functionally within the piece. I appreciated how intelligent his remarks were and the framework in which he presented the material.

 He reveals that he also transcribed [Last Train at 25 O'clock](https://open.spotify.com/track/3VPBPBZKxQu3bqeuzz8gRm?si=1ebc637444284664), which is one of my favorite songs of all time from the same album. He demo'd it for me, and I felt a strange mixture of awe at his technical skill (of performing and transcribing) and kinship through us both liking the same song so much. It was a kind of deeprooted appreciation I hadn't felt in a while.

#### Lunatico
Afterwards, we grab dinner and head over to Lunatico on our way back to listen to some live music. The ensemble consists of a jazz violinist, a guitarist, pianist, and drummer, and we listen to them improvising together. Michael and I interject their music every now and then to analyze the vibes, commenting on their musicality or the scene being conveyed, making analogies steeped in Nintendo references and other nerdy humor.

#### A moment of improvisation
I come back to his place to grab my bags, when we try to recreate the desert-ish song they'd performed at Lunatico; we wanted to place a name onto what made it sound so exotic. 

He starts playing chords, and I join in improvising melodies over them, in a moment of sincere musical connection. 

We joked, calling it a "night desert" theme in comparison to Lunatico's original version.

### 3. Surprise: Birdland Jazz

A couple days later, I get a text from Juyoun asking about what my schedule looks like on Sundayâ€”the day she comes back from her Hamptons trip. I tell her my schedule then is free, beyond a morning meeting.

Now it's Sunday, and I'm on the train back to my dorm after having catsit for Juyoun all week. And I get a surprising text from Michael, asking if I wanted to go to a jazz show tonight at Birdland Jazz. I agreed, asking how he heard about this band. And he said that Juyoun gave him two tickets, saying she likes them but could no longer make it.

The show is excellent! The Ben Paterson trio was beautifully together, displaying a mix of both musical joy and technical mastery.

But my head was full of thoughts wondering if this is really okay. I'm getting anxious that he's probably talking to other people; that I'd be thrown away if he found someone closer in age, smarter, or more attractive than me. 

And the gravity of the 10 year age gap weighed on my shoulders. Two members of the Ben Paterson Trio tossing their solos back and forth during one of their songs. They looked happy and deeply connected making music togetherâ€”in contrast with this massive distance I felt between Michael and me. I was holding back tears during the show.

As we left the show, I jokingly remarked to Michael that I was "in my feels" during one of their songs.

We said goodbye that day and I left feeling awful.

### 3.1 Art: "Goodbye"

In between lessons, I ended up sharing with him an artwork I really liked.

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2025-08-27-ten/goodbye.jpeg" alt="Real numbers" width="500"/>

We dissected the artwork, titled ["Goodbye" by totkin_ZQ](https://x.com/toktin_zq/status/1601366751366680576), for a while. 

I told him I liked it because I related with both the girl and the astronaut. 

He said "I like the astronaut is like dying and she dgaf"â€”that he got "space age siren" vibes from the art.

> "imagine being in outer space and suddenly a baddie floats by and takes off your helmet"

I laughed commenting that he's been burned too many times. That to me their love still had more basis than it being a normal Tuesday for her. And though there is a toxicity to their love (he did die), that she's clinging onto the memory of someone that gave themself up for love.

He liked the idea that it was a deeper relationship, and I ended the analysis by revealing

- I relate with the astronaut when I think about how I've loved people who've hurt me
- And I relate with the girl when I think about how I cling to people who leave. 
- Plus it's just sick

that's why I liked it.

### 4. Piano lesson #2 + Barcade

After dissecting the art, Michael sent me a reel which mentioned "the vibiest laundromat in the city." And he told me it's not even true, because that honor goes to Sunshine Laundromat: laundromat by day, pinball parlor by night. 

He told me he used to be super into pinballâ€”honing the machine-shaking technique, going to tournaments, purchasing yearlong memberships to a Pinball Museum back in California. I told him I would love to go play with him once, and we scheduled another piano lesson with a proposal to hit up Barcade and play pinball afterwards.

The night before the lesson, I was feeling I wanted to thank Michael for his kindness in transcribing two of my favorite songs from last time, with a gift. So I dusted off my iPad for the first time in years and drew him a picture as thank you.

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2025-08-27-ten/for_jeff.png" alt="Real numbers" width="500"/>

I ended up sleeping at 5am that night, waking up at 9:30am for a research meeting, then rushing onto the A train, bagel(lunch)-in-hand, to Brooklyn.

#### Sleep deprived lesson

I was feeling sleep deprived (I need my 9hrs of beauty sleep) so I couldn't follow along his lesson at the same pace as last time. I was struggling just to keep up and conceptualize the different chords.

#### A thoughtful gift exchange

He ended the lesson with a gift:\
A fully spiral-bound book with transcriptions of the entire For Lovers album.\
It was the most insane gift I've ever received. I had never felt so deeply understood in my life. 

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2025-08-27-ten/for_lovers.png" alt="Real numbers" width="700"/>

I showed him the drawing in return, and his voice softened as wellâ€”"thank you."

#### La Llama

We went to a Peruvian restaurant for dinner afterwards (called La Llama), where we were thinking of names to title his book of bird jokes. He had come up with "The Specktacular Book of Bird Jokes." To which I thought of "The Impeckable Book of Bird Jokes" as my take on the title. 

He laughed saying that's way better than "specktacular," asking what the first joke in the book would be. I racked my brain for a bit, and came up with this:

- "Why did the woodpecker get clowned on Beli for rating a place 1/10?
- Because he said it was impeckable."

It was raining outside, and his duck umbrella was still broken since last time. So we shared my umbrella and walked to Barcade to play pinball.

#### Barcade
We spent the rest of the night putzing around the different pinball machines. I sucked thoughâ€”we were playing multiplayer on one machine where he mogged me on multiple orders of magnitude.

Though I understood the physics of how the ball's trajectory changes based on the flipper timing, I was unfamiliar with the layout of the machine itself and the ways in which things could turn out badly and ricochet into the hole. (Which, to be fair, is something that is learned through just... playing more pinball.) I was getting heated, jumping in frustration every time I'd sink the ball through the flippers.

But I had a lot of fun nerding out with Michael and learning about this part of him he used to love.

#### Pavlovian fears, deeper rejections
I felt uneasy though. We had spent a lot of time together now, and it felt like we were one date away from crossing the line into relationship-territory. Even though I loved spending time with and talking to himâ€”to where it almost felt like talking to myselfâ€”I felt an almost Pavlovian response to run away.

Michael was really similar to a guy I used to like last year, which made my pattern recognition skills scream at me. That no matter how good it feels in the moment, that it can all be ripped away at any time due to circumstances out of my control.

And since he'd seen so much of me, that a rejection would feel that much more visceral. And that scared the hell out of me. 

#### Outweighed by a deeper connection
But I decided that night when I came backâ€”that though our stages of life were completely different, and that though for the next few years, my life experiences in

- struggling with my school clubs, 
- trying to find a job, 
- ...

could all be banal to him, that this lack of life stage similarity might be outweighed by our deeper artistic connection. 

That I wanted to give it a shot.

#### A Long Island trip?
Later that weekend, I was away at Copake for [HackCon](https://hackcon.mlh.io/). Though we didn't have service 95% of the time, during the patch of time when I did, I compulsively started texting Michael.

He started telling me about this Long Island trip he was planning for next Wednesday. He was reading [The Power Broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker) and wanted to visit the places Robert Moses had helped establish (Jones Beach, the scenic Southern State Pkwy) as well as visiting [this giant duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Duck). 

He went into so much detail, that I felt he was subliminally inviting meâ€”so asked if I can come with. 

He said sure! And we started planning for the trip ahead.

### Surprise: Planning Long Island

When I came back from HackCon, I looked again at the itineraryâ€”and it seemed almost too packed. So I texted Michael, wondering if we would have time to squeeze everything in, and asking if he would want to turn it into a two day trip. 

He paused for a while, before saying probably notâ€”and asked for an in-person cafe planning meeting on Monday, saying he'd be in Manhattan for a video game jam anyways.

On Monday, after yapping about linguistics at a Thai place near Columbus Circle, we walked over to [a cafe we both like](https://www.bibbleandsip.com/) to plan out entire the travel itinerary.

Afterwards, we had some more time to kill before his jam sessionâ€”and he directed us toward a nearby park, asking if we could sit down for a while. I said sure, and we sat down at a table, surrounded by lush greenery and a bright sun poking down between the tree leaves. It was a beautiful day.

## A conversation on what we are

Michael took a long pause, then started talking about how we've been hanging out a lotâ€”and I immediately started wincing, covering my eyes with my hands. And he was like "oh haha sorry, you know what's coming then."

He told me we should probably clarify what we are.

### His fears: On life stages and integration

That on his side, he's at the point where he wants his next relationship to be his last. He said he valued the connection, but whenever he would imagine

- meeting my friends
- introducing me to his parents

He would get stressed, fearing what they would think of him, since we are at such completely different life stages. And with the upcoming Long Island trip, he told me he doesn't want to string me along, feeling a sense of responsibility for bringing the conversation up in the first place.

### Me: Open minded

I told him I was open minded about pursuing something further, but that I understand I'm not in the "date-to-marry" stage in my life. I have the luxury of being in my 20s, being in a "try anything" stage instead.

### The potential problems of age gaps

I did recognize the possibility of future issues:

- I could end up developing a parental relationship where I've almost 'imprinted' onto him for emotional, intellectual, or financial dependence
- He may have to wait longer to have kids than he'd like, or I may have to have them earlier
- And other issues that we might not be forseeing

Still, I explained that how I thought a relationship between us would be fine, because we don't experience any of the real infantilization/power dynamic problems often seen in other relationships with similar age gaps.

### A strong connection

Moreover, I believed our artistic and intellectual connection was strong enough, that we could make it work, and that our life stage differences could catch up eventually. And I reassured him that my friends would be understanding if our relationship was genuine as well.

Michael agreed that our connection was strong, and that it was a shame because he doesn't get along with most people like this.

- I mirrored this sentiment, saying I've only met 3 people in the last 4 years I've had this level of connection with.
- And he remarked the last time he's felt this connection was 2.5 years ago.

### Who we consulted
We shared how the other people in our lives felt about our relationship.

Michael said he talked to Juyoun and his therapist about it, and though Juyoun was open minded, his therapist was extremely disgusted with him. In fact, she even met with her manager because she didn't want to work with someone she so fundamentally disagreed with.

I told him I talked to Raghav, Dan, and Liyu about it. And though Rag was open minded, Liyu and Dan were similarly, vehemently against it. 
- Dan remained firm that the power dynamics would inevitably taint the relationship and that I would never escape being looked down upon in some regard. 
- Liyu said that she would never see Michael in the same way again.

## Coming to an understanding

### Differing social consequences

I told him that I understood the social implications for him and me would be vastly different.

- I was coming into it as the "underdog", and would have more sympathy from an outsider's perspective
- whereas he would have to fend off grooming allegations, and deal with a persistent guilt coloring his view of our relationship

That I respect his position.

### My feelings
He told me that Juyoun said I was the type to be very understanding of other people's perspectivesâ€”which he sees as very true. But that he wants to know how I feel about this.

I laughed, thanking him for his empathy\
and told him that I feel sad\
that I'm losing such a good connection.

I taught him the korean word, "ì•„ì‰¬ì›Œ," which means "damn that sucks" in the context of a missed good thing. And Michael's eyes turned sorry.

### The future

We talked about how we should act moving forward, and we agreed we shouldn't wait with the expectation of getting back together, but that the door isn't closed entirely.

He said he doesn't like drawing arbitrary boundaries,

- and he'd love to still be friends and hang out, 
- just with the clarity that we're not heading toward a relationship

and that he hopes that I'm on some level relieved to have clarity as well.

#### Long Island?

He asked if I still want to go on the Long Island trip, that he was kicking himself when we were planning it out at the cafe, realizing he should've stopped us here first. He said he wasn't going to uninvite me because he thinks it would be fun to go together! But that he understands if I wouldn't be comfortable or would want space.

I told him that if I went on the trip, I would probably get hurt.
And that I'd pass,

â€”but that I'm happy to keep taking piano lessons and hanging out!

And asked that if I send him songs from now and then, for him to just deal with it. 

We both laughed again.
