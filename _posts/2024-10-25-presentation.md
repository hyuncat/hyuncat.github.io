Earlier today, I gave my final presentation on the coloring algorithm project at group meeting.
The presentation was supposed to give the rest of my lab mates an idea of what I was working on, and offer a chance to receive feedback.

- **the presentation** - it ended up being like a 1hr lecture explaining the background of the project, explaining a lot of definitions, really taking time to go one by one
- and i ended up assuming that people would remember a lot more of the definitions than they did - but i had to often go back and remind people, what is a symmetry operation defined as, what is a mapping operation, what are the binding constraints, etc 
- learned that giving a good presentation is about teaching
- and also it was more effective to present the problem first and to unpack the definitions step by step as they naturally came up, rather than to walk them through my final solution chronologically
	- i had went in with the assumption that if i regurgitate 20 definitions to them , that they'd somehow remember everything and follow along with my step by step, more 'concise' solution which used those definitions
	- but i ironically ended up spending 40% of the beginning of my presentation on one of the final slides in the deck - which was a picture of the example
	- walking through the example was honestly much more effective and also was able to explain the meanings of the definitions / data structures much more intuitively than my previous slides
	- why do i think it was more effective?
		- i think it's because it provides a context in which the definitions can slot into, so people aren't stuck holding onto some arbitrary definition that they don't know wtf it's used for
		- it helps organize it in the listener's mind, like for the same reason why we include tables of contents
		- it's like how the final step by step of a proof is not usually how you first encountered the solution and is likewise also not typically the most intuitive way to present the problem naturally
		- as if i present it as a problem to solve then the listeners are able to engage more with what i'm talking about and they have more 'stakes' in the matter and it's just more clear to follow
	- and even then not everyone was happy - elad brought up some concerns that i should take even more time than i did explaining the greater significance of the algorithm to the lab
	- and also that i should use the most low-level definitions possible when i can - to have the assumption that i can't expect my listeners to remember 20 different new definitions and follow along perfectly
