### crashing out -> gap year
it was november 13th, and i was staring down the big scary "december 1st" deadline on the MIT EECS program website. i'd just recovered from makecu, and i hadn't asked a single one of my professors for a letter of recommendation. 

why was it so hard to send the email?
- i kept telling myself i had to do more work on the research project before daring to ask them for a letter. 
- but with leading makecu and robotics club in general, on top of my normal schoolwork deadlines, i felt at a standstill with my responsibilities, and desperately wanted a break from life.

i texted dan mckeen, a recent doctoral defendee and resident super senior of the gang lab, asking if he was still in the office. if i could do work with him. he said sure, and i paused my balatro game, threw a jacket on top my PJs, and crawled over to the 3rd floor of mudd. 

i sit down next to his office cubicle, and he asks double checking that i've "surely asked professors for letters of recommendation by now, right?" i bury my face into my hands and avoid eye contact. he tells me "sarah. there's two weeks left until your first deadline. lock in."

we spend the rest of the night sending out all three emails. i make accounts for the application portals at each of the schools i'm thinking of applying to, and start drafting outlines for my personal statement and research statement of intent. i left that 2 hour work session having made more progress on my phd applications than i had made in the entire semester preceding it.

i sleep, feeling uneasy still.

i wake up the next morning to three emails - dr. gang and tony dear, who both agreed and asked for more information and a time to meet. but dennis shasha, emailed me what i knew was coming for a while.

> Dear Sarah,
> In principle, I'm happy to write a letter for you. However, I would have been *so* much happier if this project were done as we planned to have it done for this summer, because then my letter could attest to its usefulness for people and the paper we would have published. 
> 
> Also, to me,  you look to be a little burned out as a student. I would really want you to wait a year not being a student. There is life outside, even if you are in a lab helping with research.
> 
> Nevertheless, if you feel strongly that you want to do this, then I will write a letter. What I need from you is a word document written in the third person (e.g. Sarah did X) with
> 
> when Sarah started
> Sarah's main accomplishments in our work together
> 
> Warmly,
> Dennis

when i received this email, in some way, i felt relieved. because I knew I had been blowing off my research deadlines to dennis for the entire summer and fall semester, be it through preparing for makecu or otherwise. it was his sentiment of disappointment which i was dreading - now that i'd heard it, my gut could stop catastrophizing over it.

i told him i was open to the idea, but that i would appreciate guidance on how to move forward—asking if we could talk more on this the next time we met. he offered we meet at 4pm the same day, so we put it in the calendar for then.

i sent dan screenshots of our emails, and asked him if he had time before the meeting to chat. he said sure.

over a green chipotle chicken wrap, we talk in the cafe inside the philosophy building. he tells me that a gap year is not a bad idea, "smart even." and tells me that he's never been convinced i've wanted to actually go to grad school, given that i started preparing an application i should have started three months ago, three days ago.

i tell him that research is the end goal for me. that i love the creative process of long-form problem solving, and how it ultimately ties into my goals of doing industry ML / robotics research at a company. and that research and robotics (and math, in hindsight) have been the only things during my time at columbia which have felt "real."

he says fine, but that my GPA's on the edge for the schools i'm wanting to apply to, and that i simply don't have enough time to put together a compelling application this year. that my letter writers don't either. i leave the conversation with my head hung low, silent and resigned.

4pm arrives sooner than I'm able to catch my breath. i log onto zoom to see dennis's familiar, smiling face. "sarah, sweetie. how are you?"

i explain to him my situation and motivation for applying to grad school - the same reasons i told dan over lunch.

dennis recalls the first time he met me, full of vigor and enthusiasm - and that these days, i just seem tired. he tells me about how he was the same in his senior year of undergrad, that he was sick of school and took three years off to work at IBM, with the intention of never coming back. but that those three years were formative not only in giving him a clearer understanding of the world outside academia, but also in giving him enough time to miss school.

moreover, he tells me that my application will be much stronger next year - with projects wrapped up, he will have more he can write about in his letter of recommendation as well. i asked him "what's the harm" in applying both cycles, and he tells me that admissions committees will be more wary to accept someone who has already applied and been rejected.

with that, i resign myself to his wisdom. i tell him that i'll take his advice; slapping my face into shape: "time to find a job."
