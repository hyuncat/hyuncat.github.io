This fall semester slipped through my fingers...

As part of the Work Exemption Program, I've continued working in the Gang Lab in their pursuit to have self assembling DNA nano-materials uproot the semiconductor industry from the ground up. This semester, I took on a smaller project, to finish up my lab-idol's "Binding Library" project. This, combined with a lighter courseload, was done in the intent of applying to PhD. programs in December.

The following series of blog posts aims to capture the totality of my semester: detailing the main story beats, and including my academic, professional, and philosophical takeaways from this hectic semester.

- [Explaining the Binding Library project](/blog/binding-library)
- [Alcohol is my culture!](/blog/alcoholism2)
- [Thoughts, and the lack thereof](/blog/thoughts)
- [The MakeCU retrospective](/blog/makecu)
- [On burnout](/blog/gap-year)

I am once again grateful to the Work Exemption Program for giving me the space to fund my semester and reflect on my takeaways.
