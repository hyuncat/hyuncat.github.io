## A meditation

Dipping my toes into a cool pond\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encircled by solemn fir trees,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the murmurs of forest life,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and an audience of stars clattering with ambition

The chill shocks my spine into cognition\
as I ease my body into its cobalt still

I close my eyes.

Inside the water,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts bubble, swirl,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indecisively washing myself.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, I can make out\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mermaid-like fins from their soapy foam\
Outside the water,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear my thoughts\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sarcastically bouncing\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tracing along the rim of the pond\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bristling against the blades of grass warming the earth

Sighing, I lift myself up\
and sit atop the sill of the pond.\
The cold air breathes lukewarm onto my wet skin.

A cricket perches itself on my thigh\
an ugly thing, it ruins the mood.
