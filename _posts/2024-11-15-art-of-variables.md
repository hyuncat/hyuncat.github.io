### career thoughts
- the experience has been really rewarding
	- i enjoyed developing a large codebase and working on new features bit by bit
	- it felt similar to how it feels to immerse myself in violin and slowly learn my instrument / a new piece bit by bit - like i was working on something greater than myself

what surprised me is
- i ended up spending a lot of thought on what were in hindsight trivial problems - ex: "what do i name the class which rotates voxels?"
	- a lot of naming related questions arose - i still am unsure whether it's productive to spend SO much time thinking about the perfect name
	- but tbh when i have a good name - like symlist / symdict like it sticks with me and it's actually drastically increased the speed of coding for the coloring algorithm portion
	- so maybe the skill of naming is just something that i can get faster at with time
	- also knowing when i can black box concepts for now and come back to them later - applying the same idea to naming and just giving something a stupid name and then coming back later once i have more context in which its exact function makes sense
	- i wonder - is this what a career in tech / CS is about? i've often heard people talk about how software engineering is about writing scalable clean code - so then are the kinds of problems i would be solving in the future stuck in the realm of "what do I name this variable?"
		- i know there's more to it than that, but it feels more menial than i thought
		- maybe it's because algorithm development is harder to see tangible progress right away, unlike developing websites or applications which you see the changes / usable features relatively much quicker
	- but ultimately even if this is the day-to-day of coding, maybe each career has its own version of tedium
		- the day-to-day of playing violin is also often spent in kind of tedious tasks (slow intonation practice, playing the same 3 notes over and over again until it's in tune)
	- and ultimately i don't hate this kind of work either - i was always one to spend a lot of time naming my pokemon 
	- it's somewhat relaxing to just spend time in front of the computer and code - i still feel resolute that no matter what i do i want to still have coding be a large part of my career

analysis
- i took two proof-based courses this semester, discrete math and intro to modern analysis
- i really enjoyed it - which made me reconsider what exactly do i want to do with CS
- i had an existential crisis where i didn't even know what i wanted to major in any more
- i asked my parents why they chose to become math professors - my mom said it was because she was too dumb to become a doctor. my dad said it was because he wanted to understand the structure of space and time
- it seemed like a personality fit for them - my mom said she enjoyed having control over the classroom and the lecture notes and also that it was rewarding to see students learn
- but then why do i code? because i enjoy sitting in front of my computer and problem solving? i enjoy the impact and the feeling of contributing to something larger than myself. but do i enjoy the day-to-day? as much as something more pure like math? or like playing violin? or drawing?
- i still don't know what i want to do with myself. i don't know if i want to go to grad school or into industry.
- i think it makes sense for me to go into industry first and then think about grad school after i know a little more what i want to do?
- but my parents both went to grad school - should I not do the same?


### paperwriting
i don't have that many thoughts on this aspect as jason was doing most of the work writing the paper
but he did send me most of the drafts as he was writing them, so it was interesting to see how the paper evolved as we continued to talk and get feedback
he ended up having to rename like EVERYTHING about his algorithm
like we went from "structural" and "complementary" voxels to "class 1" and "class 2" equivalence classes?
this was after we got feedback from a theoretical physicist - (insert his name)
as someone who was working on it concurrently with jason for months i feel as if structural and complementary honestly make more sense given the role they play in the coloring algorithm
even the very name of the algorithm itself - it was unnamed for a while, lovingly referred to as "Jason's coloring algorithm" for a while. Jason and I talked for a bit and decided on CHROMAssembly as a cute name for the algorithm - based on "chromatic" referring to how the algorithm is really about choosing bond 'colors' and "Assembly" as the colors should help the lattice self assemble. but then Dr. Gang was like lets name it MOSES and now that's the name we're going with.
which again makes me think i should spend less time worrying about the name and just give things filler names and then be flexible about changing it later
