## Peking duck

there once was a duck\
with wings made of butter\
and feathers of shimmering lard

he was dripping in fat\
can you believe that! with\
a stone-whetted beak like a shard

his oil-stained trail left\
trout ripe for dressing\
to be caught by fishers a’hungry

but one day they said it—\
“his flight grew erratic”\
and sacked missiles on his greasy behind
