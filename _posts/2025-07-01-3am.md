## 3:00 AM

A stray gust startles me awake\
the grey hum of the AC roaring back up again.

Falling out of bed\
my toes probing around for the safety\
of my bed corner?\
ouch

Eyes crinkling awake\
I stumble to the bathroom\
the fluorescence sticking to my skin\
cold water grazing my hands\
and beading up as the faucet closes.

Back in bed I lay\
staring into the recesses of the ceiling

My string lights start making faces\
the sparks dancing,\
holding hands! The bulbs\
recreate stories\
twisting acidicly\
into mad contortions of themselves\
flickering pieces of shit.

A melody creeps in through the cracks of the window\
and effused with the thickness of night\
lulls me back to dreams\
of simpler problems.
