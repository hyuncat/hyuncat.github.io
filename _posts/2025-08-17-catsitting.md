Last week, Juyoun (["soul sister,"](https://cs.nyu.edu/~shasha/) lawyer, and director of the Barrio Tango Orchestra) asked me if I was interested in catsitting for her while she catsits for her friend in the Hamptons.

I said yes without hesitation. I love cats! And this would be a great experiment on whether I would be able to handle getting my own cat after leaving the dorms as well.

I popped an allergy pill and rode the train down to her apartment.

### A breakdown of responsibilities
When I got there Juyoun hugged me and gave me the rundown of what Pimple (her cat) needs to survive.

- Feed 2-3x per day
	- She eats two kinds of soups - mixtures of kibble/boiled chicken breast and water.  (Because she refuses to drink enough water if we don't trick her into doing so)
- Change the water in her bowls regardless (just in case!)
- And change the litter whenever she uses it by scooping it into toilet

It seemed simple enough! I said goodbye to Juyoun and geared up for the week ahead.

### A hesitant relationship
Pimple started off being extremely standoffish of me. Whenever I'd try to walk over to her, she'd sniff my hand and then strut away from me without even letting me pet her.

She refused to leave her little enclave by the door. I could tell she was waiting for Juyoun :,)

I told her, "Pimpleeee. Today I'm getting lunch with a friend. I'm so excited! Sorry to leave but I'll be back soon!" And she'd give me this unamused glare which screamed "bitch shut up."

### Increasing affection (and discomfort)
By the third day, Pimple was starting to finally warm up to me.

Unfortunately, the accumulating discomforts of living in someone else's apartment started grating away at me.

- The entire apartment had a terrible fruit fly infestation, and I couldn't step into the kitchen without getting swarmed by the beady-eyed buggers. 
- The air in the apartment was thickened by a mixture of sticky NYC summer humidity and cat hair—and my allergies would cycle on/off in sync with the medication's life cycle. 
	- I had a plastic trash bag hanging from the bathroom doorknob, and the used tissue mound in there steadily increased alongside my pervasive feeling of nastiness.

I felt like a pet betta fish, shell shocked after their owner changes the water in their tank. I missed my clean, air-conditioned dorm room.

Still, it the discomforts were offset by the company of a small diva—Pimple.

I think it was because I had fed and changed her litter enough times, that she started to trust my company more, nuzzling her head against my calves and marking her scent on me.

At some point, she was sitting on the entryway chair
and i plopped down next to her, computer in one hand, a cat-curious hand in the other.
Sniffing my hand, Pimple let me pet her—as I started preparing for my research meeting the following morning.


I couldn't focus though; my mind was filled with the thoughts from the week preceding me. 

After spending the entire week hanging out with people 12/7, I felt super fractured. I had hung out with people across 4 different facets of my life

- Music friends
- Robotics friends
- Gang lab friends
- Hinge "friends"

While having in my head swirling thoughts on the oppressive and stupid systems we live in.

What was I doing with my time? 

- If I seriously wanted to take actions toward change, I should be spending my time working on political/social problems. Not in DNA origami, music, or bioinformatics.
- If I'm going to be running away, why not do something more fun like hanging out with my friends, instead of whacking away at my codebase?

But then again, I wasn't always this fractured. Last summer, I was able to work for ten hours at a time. What changed?

I mean, I started doing research so I could ultimately
- secure a meaningful and well paying job
- and fund my consumption

And I stayed in my labs because
- I liked learning about
	- music, self assembly, biology - from a computational lens
	- honing the meta skill of long-term problem solving and project management
- it felt satisfying to create something
- and I liked my friends in the lab

But also, I was deeply depressed last summer. And research was honestly a way to escape my suffocating thoughts of self loathing.

- After starting prozac and making more friends last October, the running-away impetus went away

and instead, I came face-to-face with my void of intrinsic motivation.

Over the summer, I tried to create my intrinsic motivation by refactoring my life via first principles. It was after [I had just watched Interstellar](https://letterboxd.com/hyuncat/film/interstellar/), and I had decided on my preliminary set of principles.
- "Live truthfully" <- My fundamental axiom
	- Thm 1: "I don't wanna die" (live)
	- Thm 2: "Rage against the dying of the light" (try)

And tried reconciling the above with the agentic framework of me as a eating, socializing, and reproducing biological machine with the following desires:
- eat good food
- make good friends
- find a good partner

But based on these biological needs, why not just cut to the chase?

So instead of doing research out of escapism, inertia, or this possibility of a better future, why not
- spend all my time hanging out with friends and Hinge matches
- find a rich [huzz](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Huzz) and become a stay-at-home mom
- or hook myself up to an ecstasy machine?
