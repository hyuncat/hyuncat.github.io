last week, juyoun asked me if i was interested in catsitting for her while she catsits for her friends in the hamptons
i said yes without hesitation. i love cats! and this would be an experiment on whether i would be able to handle getting my own cat after leaving the dorms.
i popped an allergy pill and rode the train down to her apt

the framework was simple

- feed pimple 2-3x per day
	- mix water into her food (because she refuses to drink enough water otherwise)
	- creating these two "soups" (kibble and chicken)
- change water regardless
- scoop litter into toilet

pimple started off extremely standoffish\
i would try to pet her and she'd strut away from me\
i'd regale her with stories and she'd be like bitch shut up

on the second day, i stayed home and hung out with pimple all day

unfortunately, the accumulating discomforts of living in someone else's apartment started grating away at me.

- the entire apartment had a terrible fruit fly infestation, and I couldn't step into the kitchen without getting swarmed by the beady-eyed bastards. 
- the air in the apartment was thickened by a mixture of sticky NYC summer humidity and cat hair, and my allergies would cycle on/off in sync with the medication's life cycle. 
- i had a plastic trash bag hanging from the bathroom doorknob, and the used tissue mound in there steadily increased alongside my pervasive feeling of nastiness.

i felt like my middle school betta fish, shell shocked after their owner changes the water in their tank. i missed my clean, air-conditioned dorm room.

still, it was offset by the company of a small diva - pimple
after feeding her and changing her litter, she started to trust my company more\
nuzzling her head against my calves and marking her scent on me

she had been refused to leave her little enclave by the door (waiting for juyoun, presumably)\
but at some point she was sitting on an entryway chair \
and i plopped down next to her, computer in one hand, a cat-curious hand in the other\
after sniffing my hand, pimple let me pet her - and i started gearing up to prepare for my research meeting the following morning

but my mind was filled with the thoughts from the week preceding me. \
after spending the entire week hanging out with people 12/7, i felt super fractured. i hung out with people across 4 different facets of my life

- music friends - liyu, jeff, juyoun (la nacional), max
- robotics friends - joseph, CCBR
- ganglab friends - dan, rag
- hinge "friends" - bosco
all while reflecting on my conversations on the oppressive systems we live in
- that if i seriously wanted to combat the system that i should be spending my time working on political problems
	- not in DNA origami, psychoacoustics, or bioinformatics
- and that if i'm going to be running away, i might as well have more fun with it than i have with research (in hanging out with friends)

i wondered what caused this shift in the first place\
recalling how i was able to lock in for 10 hours at a time last summer

i mean, i started doing research because

- i liked learning about
	- music, self assembly, biology - from a computational lens
	- honing the meta skill of long-term problem solving and project management
	- it felt satisfying to create something
- i was doing research and learning how to problem solve 

ultimately so i could 
	- get a good job
	- spend time with cool people
	- and fund my consumption

but also, i was deeply depressed last summer. and research was honestly a way to escape my suffocating thoughts of self loathing
- after starting prozac and making more friends last october, the running-away impetus went away

and instead, i came face-to-face with my void of intrinsic motivation.

after watching interstellar (link the letterboxd review), i had refactored my life via first principles

- "live truthfully" <- the fundamental axiom
	- thm 1: "i don't wanna die" (live)
	- thm 2: "rage against the dying of the light" (try)

and the agentic framework of me as a eating / socializing / reproducing biological machine with the following needs

- eat good food
- make good friends
- find a good partner

i realized my current motivation problem is because based on my biological needs, why not just cut to the chase?\
so instead of doing research out of escapism, inertia, or this possibility of a better future\
why not

- spend all my time hanging out with friends and hinge matches
- find a rich huzz and become a stay-at-home mom
- or hook myself up to an ecstasy machine?

at some point, i recalled learning about maslow's hierarchy of needs in my high school AP psychology class

I was talking to ryan from CCBR about this on saturday, and how i think maslow's hierarchy of needs could be related to the solution to my problem

- of satisfying a weighted combination of both my base and higher order desires at any given slice of time
hearing this, he mirrored my same sentiment
- ryan: "you have a void of self actualization"

### model-free vs model-based learning
on sunday, we went to the bryant park library to get caught up on the RL literature\
and i learned that for state-of-the-art robotics policy training, that there exist two broad learning paradigms

1. model-based learning
2. model-free (policy) learning

**model-based:** if model is available, agent can plan ahead explicitly

- can be provided ahead of time - eg, chess game where all rules and board states easily described
- or learned on the go - but this is very hard and requires lots of data / compute

**model-free:** in real world typically full model is hard to provide, agent should learn the model from experience

- just find the best actions they can take to maximize their reward

**rk:** connection to whether i should live my life through a solipsist lens vs trying to uncover the universal truth

- the fact we're gonna use model-free PPO/SAC to train our quadruped probably means we don't know enough about the world to try the model-based approach (universal truth)
- so spending my time fine-tuning my reward function instead of trying to discover some universal truth is probably a better use of my time

and after sharing this with ryan, he remarked that maybe the solution could also lie in an inverse kinematics approach

- where you start with a goal, 
- in the context of certain assumptions on the world, 
- and retrace the agent's actions needed to get to the goal

where both the assumptions and the actions are being updated at each step

pimple nuzzled her head against my hand\
guiding me to the spots she wanted to be scratched\
showing me her belly. she trusted me

but i still felt like a bad cat mom\
i was away for a lot of yesterday hanging out with bosco\
and this little guy was relying on me for food, for water, to clean her litter\
for affection

and i thought to how dennis, dr. hur, dr. gang, my robotics club, CCBR\
how they were relying on me to get my work done in a similar fashion as well\
they took me on with the expectation of me getting certain work done\
and just like i had a responsibility to take care of pimple\
and i had a responsibility to them to fulfill for placing their trust in me

and i tried to reverse engineer why i should do work for them beyond this trust


i remembered how much i love art

base (5 senses) art

- auditory (music)
- visual
	- drawings
	- architecture/design
- taste
	- food
	- drink
- touch
	- sex, love
- smell
	- perfumes, candles

higher order art

- linguistic (communication, social)
- relationships - to create something more beautiful in our union

and that i create art because

- feels good to be understood
- feels good to leave a part of me into the world

and how that's my form of self actualization

so in the context of art as my self actualization goal,
research and problem solving really becomes the tool

- for which i can understand and break down systems
- by finding patterns (through both similarity and dissimilarity)

i asked myself why do people solve problems?

- feels good to no longer face the problem
- nice to feel needed by people who the solution helps
- feels good to get closer to the truth of the world

so i framed my research motivation problem as a set of tangible problems

- idk what i'm gonna do next year
- people are waiting on me to finish these projects
- i feel stupid and guilty for letting other people down
- i want to eventually make enough money to afford the kind of art i want to experience

with the following solution: finishing these projects

- so that i can start and choose my next one to be more aligned with my better understanding of the world
- with the knowledge that i better not entangle myself in more than 3 major projects at once
