## Blueberry yogurt

Today, I shuffled up the stairs\
to make myself some blueberry yogurt.

I flicked the lights on\
treading carefully, to not\
disturb the sleeping (or the pests).

I peek out the window:\
I must have caught the one hour\
where the city is dimmest.

I pick up my spoon\
with a scoopful of frozen blueberries\
and dip it into the tub.

My teeth crush the snow\
-covered winter blue. It tastes\
simple, milky tart, and icy.

I pull my jacket a little closer to me—\
for a moment, this is all.
