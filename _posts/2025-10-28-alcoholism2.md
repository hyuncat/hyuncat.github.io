## Alcohol is my culture!
Over the summer, I spent time learning more about food and alcohol as part of my "learning more about the world" era. This semester, coursework and deadlines be damned, I kept treading along my quest to eat and drink well.

There was no concerted plan—just a guiding feeling that I wanted to keep trying new restaurants and bars. In the end, I ended up trying ~30 new places this semester. 

Standouts include...
- The fluffiest, chewiest lox bagel I've ever had (@Apollo Bagels),
- heartwarming udon noodles from Raku,
- a delightful corn pastry from Lysee,
- and a scarily accurate Japanese cold noodle cocktail from Double Chicken Please 
Underlying all this exploration, I also carved out time for a weekly pilgrimage to Cho Dang Gol. 😉

### Food and stories
Writing this, I was trying to rack my brain for a tying narrative thread across all the places I'd visited this semester.  Unfortunately, the only common denominator between all these places is ME: an upstart Korean American college student in her early 20's, trying new restaurants based on her friends' recommendations. 

Each recommendation itself comes from a story—Double Chicken Please came from the resident Gang Lab alcoholic, who broke up with his ex-girlfriend in college because she drank too much. Raku, from a summertime friend I'd gone clubbing with. Lysee, from a mentally unstable robotics friend.

This semester, I realized that visiting restaurants with friends, having deep conversations over good food, is what I live for. Small, isolated moments of connection, learning more about myself, others, and the world.

who am i based on what food i like
- korean american that likes experimenting with creative food combinations
- valuing humor -> valuing innovation and creativity in flavor combinations
- when I want to be comforted, i go for warm korean flavors because they remind me of my childhood

exploration vs comfort
- conversation with bryan where he was shitting on gastronomy for being a sterile way of approaching food, which should serve the function of comfort
- i disagreed, but it brings to question what balance one should strike between the two

i see the dichotomy mirrored in cho dang gol vs. double chicken please, though to different extents

if you want a classic "good" cocktail, you get a gin and tonic. or a "good" whiskey. but double chicken please is about pushing the boundary of what a drink can look like - i got their signature "japanese cold noodle" drink and was shocked at how accurate it was. but would i order it again? no...

meanwhile, i go to CDG every week. whenever i'm having a bad day, i go to CDG and their tofu stews cheer me up. they are comforting, high quality, and delicious.

### Storytime
not everything can be connected with a story.
the tying thread between all these places is ME: an upstart korean american college student in her early 20s trying to taste good food based on her friends' recommendations.

what have i learned from all this?
- being friends with a guy from southern china has helped me learn to appreciate oily food - rich and flavorful foods
- being friends with a pretentiously unpretentious alcoholic has wisened me to the world of cocktail gastronomy - the art of recreating the essence of other flavor combinations within the morphology of an alcoholic drink
- ...and that i should make more friends.

### Pepero day
it was pepero day, and i felt a little sad. 
i was walking back from orchestra rehearsal, and decided i'd buy all the pepero i could find from hmart. 

got three of my friends, two from the lab and one from robotics, all together to rank the flavors. i put my spreadsheet-making skills to the test and we rated them one by one.

next steps - i want to engage more deeply with food. i've been "consuming" a lot of food, but i want to start "creating". i used to view food as a frivolous endeavor, only serving to obstruct me on my weight loss journey. redefining food as a mechanism of connection through a representation of culture, while satisfying the human need for sustenance. in the same way we put in effort for relationships, i want to gain a baseline working understanding of all the components of life, including food and drink.

### Drinking and living?
Earlier in the summer, while I was in my "wanting to flow out my life through axioms" phase: I asked my dad for feedback on my "live truthfully" axiom. He shared that his would be "정신 차리고 살자." I asked him how drinking alcohol fits into that axiom, to which he replied "Alcohol cools down my brain that is always occupied by too many things. So, it helps sometimes."
