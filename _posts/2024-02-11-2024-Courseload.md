---

This blog is mostly a way to document my further explorations of what I'm learning in my classes. 

My current courseload is:
- Partial Differential Equations
- Artificial Intelligence
- Intro to Databases
- Full-Stack Web Development
- Contemporary Civilizations (...a required core class)

I'll also be posting updates on current projects and other things that interest me. Thanks for reading!
