## Sunfall

I was walking to the office today\
when I saw the sun falling from the sky.

Rocketing down,\
it brushed away the clouds as it fell\
catching stray eagles with its shrapnel\
and squeezed its way through\
between the cracks of the scaffolding above me.

It landed in front of me.\

I would've worn something nicer if I knew it was falling today.
