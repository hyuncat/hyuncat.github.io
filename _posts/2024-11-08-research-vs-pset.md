- research culture is more chill in some ways in that there's not like psets due every week
- but in a way it made me thankful for the psets as psets have a very defined clear problem and solution method whereas in research you have to also create your own problems to solve
- and depending on how i choose what problems to solve i can end up wasting a bunch of time
- like recall my game trees? i wrote this whole script to debug something at the end
- i used a game tree and optimization and spent like 20 hours rewriting a bunch of data structures to accommodate this post-processing script
- but it turned out that it was a completely avoidable problem just by fixing the algorithm so i didn't have to retroactively fix it like this in the first place
- which would've been easily solvable if i just was better at reaching out to jason
