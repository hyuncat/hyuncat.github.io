## Sand pustules

I was playing on the beach this morning\
but now I have sand everywhere.

I tried everything. Scrubbing\
only massaged it deeper inside.\
Shaking my limbs tired me out.

Stupid sand! I'll rub every\
last one of you out! 

I sat down. Like a clock,\
counting pore-by-pore,\
pinching, at the root,\
squeezing out every grain,

until my body was red,\
over-exfoliated, but clean.
