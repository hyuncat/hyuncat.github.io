## Eurydice and the porridge pot

I pinch my nose and start\
my wading through the amber murk\
the porridge pot hides honeyed traps\
blueberry buoys, oats and cream\
a barely dormant geyser luring prey

a half-dipped spoon\
it tethers me to flurried steam above\
though slippery on its silver edge\
I wrap my limbs around its flowered etchings\
clinging, sliding, slowly scaling

sweet allure, a hidden folly\
the taste of fingers cleanly licked\
from well-meaned mouths above

they lift the spoon\
and I come too
