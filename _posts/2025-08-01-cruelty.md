systemic violence 
- sean - MKULTRA
- mckeen - history of iran
- redeker - iphones and asian child labor
- liyu - healthtech startup, denying care

needing to "lie" to be happy
- feeling helpless at the cruelty of a problem you can't solve
- lying - running away, delusion, irony

so many people i admire are deeply cynical
- maybe it's because smart people are used to solving problems
- so they feel more cynical and even more hurt when they see the world 
	- because it's a much much bigger problem than they can handle
so the powerlessness hurts more
1. to their ego
2. because of their understanding of the consequences of the problem

eg
- max sees the world through an ironic lens and postmarks his tangents with "but idk anything"
- hell redeker was talking about how he saw a video of ICE trick a mother into coming out by getting the daughter to tell her to come out
	- and how it was demoralizing and depressing to see such a tragedy unfold in front of him
- liyu told us about how she was heartbroken at a young age after realizing her clothes were produced in a sweatshop

i think the problem is with our inadequate response to globalism
- social media - a global "online" culture
- capitalism, consumerism, the impersonalization problem
	- people evolved to live in societies of 300, not 8 billion
	- ant wars, tribalism

case studies on former drug addicts
- eli - comically cynical
- redeker - irony, sincerity through research (running)
- sean - irony, political trolling

how should you live in a cruel context?
- takeaways from being in a self assembly lab
- starling flocking behavior
- grassroots movements - conversations, actions
