My current color palette + obsidian graph.

### Color palette
I've been trying to diversify my taste in colors - I used to be obsessed with pastels/muted tones for a while, but I'm trying to challenge myself to use more vibrant colors and thinking more critically about the harmonies in the colors I choose. This palette is currently a good representation of the colors I'm leaning toward right now.

### Obsidian graph
After moving to Obsidian at the beginning of this summer, I've had a lot of fun seeing how the different labs I'm in all interconnect and branch off each other. This is the current state of my Obsidian graph, annotated with the respective projects/labs I'm in.

The grey nodes represent general CS notes, such as those corresponding to a particular programming language or library. I'm really happy with the graph so far! It almost feels like I'm tending to my mind's garden.
