## Splash?

A flowering water lily,\
It floats languidly, dotting the marsh\
with its frail blooms.

Bobbing, waving,\
blushing, sleeping.

The sky murmurs from above,\
bullets raining into\
the crevices of its petals.\
Each drop spilling in, \
weighing down the lily's bloom.

Cruel thunder!\
She cracks her belt,\
warning the lily of a bolt inbound.

A wind breathes\
and the lily breathes back.
