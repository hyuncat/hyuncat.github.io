## The end
**12/3/24, 3:32am** - A manuscript titled Arbitrary Design of DNA-Programmable 3D Crystals through Symmetry Mapping (nn-2024-17408d) has been submitted by Dr. Oleg Gang to ACS Nano.

It's over. The paper is submitted.

The goal we set out to accomplish toward the beginning of October, has finally happening. It was a long journey of many dozens of manuscript drafts, meetings with multiple people, hundreds of hours poured into this project. I feel an eerie mix of relief, pride, and emptiness. It's over. ðŸ˜­

Would I do it again?

Sure I would - and plan to. It was a rewarding experience unlike any other. 

## Takeaways
My key takeaways from this experience:
### 1. Research is hard
My coursework seems so much easier in comparison to this work. I set very ambitious goals in the beginning of wanting to tread new ground regarding integrating temperature control in the DNA origami formation process. But I got stuck troubleshooting the algorithm and debugging for months.

It's even harder trying to juggle it with schoolwork - I recall the beginning of the semester having multiple breakdowns planning out meticulously how I was going to fit 30 hours of work into a 48 hour period - especially during the preparation for the presentation, or the nights before meetings.

### 2. Research is about problem-solving (and choosing)
Research is about choosing the right problems and how to solve them. And the problems don't always have answers.

I always think back to the color tree post processing script - how did I let myself spend 20 hours on 600 useless lines of code, researching optimization techniques to make it run faster, when in reality I was solving entirely the wrong problem and just wasting my time.

### 3. Communicate
Let go of your ego and communicate with your mentors - they will help keep you from being sidetracked too far.'

## Learned?
### 1. How to manage time
I got into Google Calendar because of research! Otherwise I would not be able to keep track of all my meetings. It kept me busy enough to where I started religiously tracking all the time I would spend.

### 2. How to lock in
Because of the time crunch that trying to squeeze in research created, it also forced me to extract as much productivity out of the limited time I did have.

My strategy? Pomodoro to get started if I can't motivate myself. Locking myself in a room in Butler library until I finish. Interspersing walking breaks. Focusing on what is my goal and rigorously filtering out any unnecessary digressions in my path to achieving the goal (no matter how small - for example, one goal was "fix the helix problem").

### 3. How to group things
Immersing myself in one subject, one codebase, for months, has taught me the value of quality organization as the prerequisite to iteration. Trying to work on the same codebase and remember everything I'd done in the past would not have been possible without intensive docstrings and sensible class, method, and file organization. 

I learned the SOLID framework for organization.
- Single responsibility
- Open/closed module design
- Liskov substitution
- Interface segregation
- Dependency inversion

Which you can watch more about [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1qKv5TBaOA), but is essentially, the art of how to group things effectively. Which is a massive skill that has translated to also grouping notes together in playing violin, in grouping math concepts for Modern Analysis, and just my life in general has become a question of how to most effectively group new stimulus together in order to best use it and iterate upon it for the future. Really one of the most powerful skills I've learned from research. 

## Career?
Has this experience helped clarify my career goals? I feel weirdly even more lost than I started the semester. Do I want to go into academia? Do I want to go into industry and then return for my PhD? I think for now I want to do the latter (some good mentors of mine have done the same path), but again I have no idea. I really enjoyed the process of researching and found the creative liberty freeing and uniquely rewarding. Yet I don't know if I love the pressure to eke out papers for the sake of papers. And I don't know if I want to go down the academia route, like my parents did (they're both math professors). 

Anyways, thank you so much again to the Work Exemption Program for helping fund my excursion into research. It has really enriched my experience here at Columbia and has enabled me to contribute meaningfully to the field of DNA nanotechnology. I'm really so grateful. Thank you.
